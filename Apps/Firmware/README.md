Build
-----

GNOME Firmware uses the [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system together with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).

In order to build, go to the project root directory, run `meson build_dir_name`, where `build_dir_name` is the name of the directory meson will create to store build files.

After that, navigate to the newly created build directory and run `ninja`.

This will create an executable located in the `src` folder of the build dir. named `gnome-firmware`.

Please note, it's sufficient to run `meson` only once. You can find a list of dependencies below:

### Fedora
`sudo dnf install meson ninja-build fwupd-devel gtk3-devel help2man libhandy-devel`
