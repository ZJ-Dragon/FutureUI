# Ideas for new features are welcome!

Please share your feature ideas in our Discourse in order to discuss them with our community:

https://discourse.gnome.org/tag/nautilus

Quite some evaluation plus refinement has to happen between an idea and creating an actual and detailed plan for a potential implementation. We found that they develop into actionable issues best when they are discussed beforehand.

However, if you've got this idea because of an existing problem in the application, please don't forget to report the bug or shortcoming using the respective template.
